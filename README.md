# google-coding-challenge-2021
This is my solution to the Google Coding Challenge 2021 which I took part in during a virtual internship run by Bright Network.

Most of the code I have written is stored in the video_player.py file. During the challenge I was implementing all required functions and testing their functionality 
with a use of test prepared by Google Team. All my work was done in Python.

What I have learned:
- how to clean messy code
- how to refactor code
- how to interact with objects and classes
